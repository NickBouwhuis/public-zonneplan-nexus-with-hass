# Public Zonneplan Nexus with Home Assistant
This code will let you expose your Zonneplan Nexus data to the internet, so others can follow its progress.

[Zonneplan has their own demo on their website](https://www.zonneplan.nl/thuisbatterij/nexus-demo) and this will let you compare other 'real' installations.

Mine is public on https://nick.bouwhuis.net/homebattery/

And this is the code.

It's mostly ChatGPT engineering and there is room for improvement. For example, it can cache the results and only fetch new details based on the 'Last Measurement' entity. Right now it fetches data for all endpoints every minute. 

Looking forward to your pull requests! ðŸ˜Š
